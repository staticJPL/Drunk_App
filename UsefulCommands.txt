readelf -d build-clang-asan/drunk_app | grep NEEDED
nm -a build-clang-asan/drunk_app | grep -E '__asan_|__ubsan_' | head -n 20 // Determine symbols inside the binary. ASan baked in it seems.

nm → “what symbols/functions are inside this binary?”

readelf -d → “what shared libs does this binary need at runtime?”

| grep ... → “filter down to just what I care about”

head -n ... → “don’t flood my terminal”

2>&1 → “include error output in the pipe too”
